            This page is designed for women and AFAB people who suspect autistic traits, want structured self-reflection, and curated links to reliable resources. The self-assessment runs in 8 stages (one at a time) and scores each stage separately. After completing all 8 stages you'll get a combined score, a probability estimate, and suggested subtype/manifestation matches based on which areas were highest.

          <h2>About – purpose & quick learning bites</h2>

          <div class="muted about-intro">
            This self-assessment is a screening tool adapted from the project sources to help women/AFAB people reflect on traits commonly under-recognized in female presentations of autism. It is not diagnostic – use it to gather examples, track patterns, and prepare for a clinical conversation.

          <h3>Key learning bites</h3>
          <div class="about-block">
            <div class="bite">
              <div class="title">What is autism?</div>
              <div class="content">Autism is a neurodevelopmental difference affecting social communication, sensory processing and repetitive patterns of behavior. It is lifelong and varies greatly between people.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="bite">
              <div class="title">How it can look in adults</div>
              <div class="content">In adults, signs can include difficulty reading emotions, high anxiety in social settings, literal interpretation of language, and strict routines – but presentation varies. Gathering childhood examples helps with assessment.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="bite">
              <div class="title">Female-presenting differences</div>
              <div class="content">Women and girls often 'mask' by mimicking social behaviours, using scripts, or camouflaging stimming – which makes detection harder and leads to late or missed diagnoses.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="bite">
              <div class="title">ADHD & co-occurrence</div>
              <div class="content">Autism and ADHD commonly co-occur; executive function and attention challenges may overlap and complicate assessment or support planning. Make sure clinicians consider both.</div>

            <li>When do you feel most exhausted after social encounters? How long to recover?</li>
            <li>Have you developed scripts, rehearsed phrases, or suppressed movements/stims to fit in?</li>

        If screening indicates elevated traits:
        <ol>
          <li>Gather developmental history (childhood examples) and any school/medical reports.</li>
          <li>Take your report to your GP or a clinical psychologist experienced in adult autism assessments.</li>
          <li>Consider local support groups (AWN, NAS) and peer networks for lived-experience guidance.</li>

        Note: co-occurring ADHD is common; assessment pathways should consider both conditions together for accurate formulation.
