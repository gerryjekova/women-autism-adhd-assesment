        <h2>About – purpose & quick learning bites</h2>
        <p>This self-assessment is a screening tool adapted from the project sources to help women/AFAB people reflect on traits commonly under-recognized in female presentations of autism. It is not diagnostic – use it to gather examples, track patterns, and prepare for a clinical conversation.</p>

        <div class="about-block">
            <h3>Key learning bites</h3>
            <div class="bite">
                <strong>What is autism?</strong>
                <p>Autism is a neurodevelopmental difference affecting social communication, sensory processing and repetitive patterns of behavior. It is lifelong and varies greatly between people.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bite">
                <strong>How it can look in adults</strong>
                <p>In adults, signs can include difficulty reading emotions, high anxiety in social settings, literal interpretation of language, and strict routines – but presentation varies. Gathering childhood examples helps with assessment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bite">
                <strong>Female-presenting differences</strong>
                <p>Women and girls often 'mask' by mimicking social behaviours, using scripts, or camouflaging stimming – which makes detection harder and leads to late or missed diagnoses.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bite">
                <strong>ADHD & co-occurrence</strong>
                <p>Autism and ADHD commonly co-occur; executive function and attention challenges may overlap and complicate assessment or support planning. Make sure clinicians consider both.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Reflection prompts (try writing these down)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>List 3 childhood examples where routines, special interests or social differences stood out.</li>
            <li>When do you feel most exhausted after social encounters? How long to recover?</li>
            <li>Have you developed scripts, rehearsed phrases, or suppressed movements/stims to fit in?</li>
            <li>Do sensory things (lights, sounds, texture) trigger strong physical reactions?</li>
            <li>Has anything changed across menstrual/hormonal cycles? (some people report fluctuations)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next steps & practical guidance</h2>
        <p>If screening indicates elevated traits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather developmental history (childhood examples) and any school/medical reports.</li>
            <li>Take your report to your GP or a clinical psychologist experienced in adult autism assessments.</li>
            <li>Consider local support groups (AWN, NAS) and peer networks for lived-experience guidance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: co-occurring ADHD is common; assessment pathways should consider both conditions together for accurate formulation.</p>

        <h3>How to use these results</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Screening only – not a clinical diagnosis.</li>
            <li>If results are elevated, consider discussing with a GP or specialist.</li>
            <li>Take notes on childhood development & examples to bring to appointments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>About scoring & staging</h3>
        <p>This tool divides screening into targeted areas: social communication, restricted/repetitive behaviour, executive function/ADHD traits, female-specific manifestations (masking, hormonal impacts), sensory/co-occurring features, burnout/energy, masking strategies, and life impact – each stage scored separately to reflect area-specific patterns. (Based on your provided materials.)</p>
